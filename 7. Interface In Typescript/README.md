# Interface in TypeScript

### Why use interface

- when we have to declare data types of any variable we can declare easily. but when we focus on class or object then we can't declare its data type because it have its own property at that time interface play most important role

### How to use interface

Syntax:-

```TypeScript
interface interface_name{
    property_type:data_type,
    property_type:data_type
}
```
