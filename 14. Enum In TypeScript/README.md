# Enum in TypeScript

## What is Enum?

- Enums stands for Enumerations. Enums are a new data type supported in TypeScript. It is used to define the set of named constants, i.e., a collection of related values. TypeScript supports both numeric and string-based enums. We can define the enums by using the enum keyword.

## Why Enums?

- Enums are useful in TypeScript because of the following:

  - It makes it easy to change values in the future.
  - It reduces errors which are caused by transporting or mistyping a number.
  - It exists only during compilation time, so it does not allocate memory.
  - It saves runtime and compile-time with inline code in JavaScript.
  - It allows us to create constants that we can easily relate to the program.
  - It will enable developers to develop memory-efficient custom constants in JavaScript, which does not support enums, but TypeScript helps us to access them.

- There are three types of Enums in TypeScript. These are:

  - Numeric Enums
  - String Enums
  - Heterogeneous Enums
